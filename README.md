# Utilities Package
 A package of API and database monitoring utilities that I made with Flask during my internship at AgileField the summer of 2018.

## Dependencies

This project was built with Flask on python 3. The following python packages are used:

* flask
* flask-wtf
* flask-bootstrap
* pg8000
* requests

## Usage

The project could be hosted locally by navigating to the root folder then using the standard method for starting Flask apps:
`FLASK_APP=utilities.py`
then 
`flask run.`

The project no longer functions as intended since the referenced APIs are no longer in use.
